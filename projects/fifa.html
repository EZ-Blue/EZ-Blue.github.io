    <h1>FIFA Players Analysis: Predictive Modeling of Player Ratings Using Machine Learning</h1>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        The sports analytics industry has grown exponentially in recent years, revolutionizing how teams evaluate talent, 
        make strategic decisions, and allocate resources. In the realm of football (soccer), player evaluation remains a 
        complex challenge that combines subjective assessment with quantitative metrics. The FIFA video game series, 
        with its comprehensive player attribute database, provides a unique opportunity to explore how various skills 
        and characteristics contribute to overall player ratings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This project analyzes FIFA player data from 2015 to 2022, leveraging machine learning techniques to predict 
        player overall ratings based on their individual attributes. Understanding the relationship between specific 
        skills and overall performance has significant implications for talent scouts, team managers, and sports 
        analysts who seek to identify undervalued players or predict future stars.
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of this research extends beyond gaming, as FIFA's player ratings are developed by a network of over 
        9,000 data reviewers, including talent scouts and coaches, making it one of the most comprehensive player 
        assessment databases in the sport. By developing accurate predictive models, we can gain insights into which 
        attributes most significantly influence player evaluations in professional football.

    <div class="project-section">
      <h2>Methods</h2>
      
      <h3>Data Collection and Processing</h3>
      <p>
        We utilized a comprehensive dataset of FIFA players spanning from 2015 to 2022, containing over 100 attributes 
        for each player. The dataset includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Basic player information (name, age, nationality)</li>
        <li>Physical attributes (height, weight)</li>
        <li>Technical skills (passing, shooting, dribbling)</li>
        <li>Mental attributes (vision, composure, positioning)</li>
        <li>Contract and club information</li>
        <li>Position-specific performance ratings</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>
        The data was processed using PySpark, a distributed computing framework ideal for handling large datasets. 
        We implemented a multi-stage data engineering pipeline:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Data Integration</strong>: Combined male and female player data across multiple years (2015-2022)</li>
        <li><strong>Data Cleaning</strong>: Handled missing values through imputation techniques</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Engineering</strong>: Converted categorical variables and prepared numerical features</li>
        <li><strong>Data Transformation</strong>: Standardized features for model compatibility</li>
      </ol>

      <div class="code-block">
<pre><code># Defining our pipeline for data preprocessing
def get_preprocess_pipeline():
    # Stage where columns are casted as appropriate types
    stage_typecaster = FeatureTypeCaster()

    # Stage where ordinal columns are transformed to index columns
    stage_ordinal_indexer = StringIndexer(inputCols=ordinal_cols, outputCols=ordinal_id_cols)

    # Stage where the index columns are further transformed using OneHotEncoder
    stage_ordinal_onehot_encoder = OneHotEncoder(inputCols=ordinal_id_cols, outputCols=ordinal_onehot_cols)

    # Combine all OHE columns for vector assembly
    feature_cols = (ordinal_onehot_cols + binary_cols + continuous_cols)
    stage_vector_assembler = VectorAssembler(inputCols=feature_cols, outputCol="vectorized_features")

    # Stage where we scale the columns
    stage_scaler = StandardScaler(inputCol='vectorized_features', outputCol='features')

    # Connect the stages into a pipeline
    pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[stage_typecaster,
                                stage_ordinal_indexer,
                                stage_ordinal_onehot_encoder,
                                stage_vector_assembler,
                                stage_scaler])
    return pipeline</code></pre>
      </div>

      <p>
        For the analysis, we used PostgreSQL as our database management system due to its support for structured 
        data and ACID transactions, which was essential for maintaining data integrity when combining multiple datasets.
      </p>

      <h3>Machine Learning Models</h3>
      <p>
        We implemented and compared four distinct machine learning approaches to predict player overall ratings:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Linear Regression (PySpark)</strong>: A baseline model to establish linear relationships between player attributes and overall ratings.</li>
        <li><strong>Random Forest Regressor (PySpark)</strong>: A tree-based ensemble method to capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.</li>
        <li><strong>Multi-Layer Perceptron (TensorFlow)</strong>: A neural network with four layers (128, 64, 32, 1 neurons) using ReLU activation functions.</li>
        <li><strong>Convolutional Neural Network (TensorFlow)</strong>: A 1D CNN architecture to identify patterns in player attributes.</li>
      </ol>
      
      <p>
        For each model, we performed hyperparameter tuning through cross-validation to optimize performance. 
        The dataset was split into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets to ensure unbiased evaluation.
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="project-section">
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Our analysis yielded several key findings regarding model performance and the predictive power of different 
        player attributes:
      </p>

      <h3>Model Performance Comparison</h3>
      <p>
        The Random Forest Regressor significantly outperformed other models, achieving the highest accuracy and 
        lowest error metrics:
      </p>

      <table class="results-table">
        <tr>
          <th>Model</th>
          <th>Test Accuracy</th>
          <th>Test MSE</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Linear Regression</td>
          <td>97.44%</td>
          <td>4.52</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Random Forest (Optimized)</td>
          <td>99.06%</td>
          <td>0.66</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Multi-Layer Perceptron</td>
          <td>96.91%</td>
          <td>2.33</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>Convolutional Neural Network</td>
          <td>97.86%</td>
          <td>0.91</td>
        </tr>
      </table>

      <p>
        The optimized Random Forest model with 15 trees and a maximum depth of 10 demonstrated superior performance, 
        suggesting that decision tree-based approaches are particularly well-suited for this type of predictive task.
      </p>

      <h3>Feature Importance</h3>
      <p>
        Analysis of the Random Forest model revealed that certain player attributes were consistently more influential 
        in determining overall ratings:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Technical Skills</strong>: Dribbling, passing, and shooting showed the highest correlation with overall ratings</li>
        <li><strong>Physical Attributes</strong>: Pace and strength were moderately important</li>
        <li><strong>Mental Attributes</strong>: Positioning, vision, and composure had significant impacts, particularly for certain positions</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This aligns with football domain knowledge, where technical precision often distinguishes elite players from average ones.
      </p>

      <h3>Model Generalization</h3>
      <p>
        The models showed consistent performance across different years of FIFA data (2015-2022), indicating that the 
        relationship between player attributes and overall ratings remains relatively stable over time. This temporal 
        consistency suggests that our models capture fundamental aspects of player evaluation rather than year-specific trends.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>

      <h3>Implications and Applications</h3>
      <p>
        The high predictive accuracy of our models, particularly the Random Forest approach, demonstrates that player 
        overall ratings can be reliably predicted from individual attributes. This has several practical implications:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Talent Identification</strong>: Scouts and analysts can use similar models to identify undervalued players 
        whose individual attributes suggest higher potential than their current market valuation.</li>
        <li><strong>Player Development</strong>: Teams can focus training resources on developing specific attributes that most 
        significantly impact overall performance for different positions.</li>
        <li><strong>Transfer Market Strategy</strong>: Clubs with limited financial resources can leverage these insights to 
        target players with high-value attributes at lower costs.</li>
        <li><strong>Gaming Strategy</strong>: For FIFA game players, understanding which attributes most influence overall ratings 
        can improve team-building and player acquisition decisions.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Limitations</h3>
      <p>
        Despite the strong performance of our models, several limitations should be acknowledged:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Subjective Nature of Ratings</strong>: FIFA ratings, while comprehensive, still contain subjective elements 
        that may not perfectly reflect actual player abilities.</li>
        <li><strong>Position Specificity</strong>: The importance of attributes varies significantly by position, which our 
        general models may not fully capture.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal Changes</strong>: While our models showed good generalization across years, the evaluation criteria 
        in football evolve over time with changing tactical trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Data Constraints</strong>: Some player attributes in the dataset contained missing values that required 
        imputation, potentially introducing bias.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Future Research Directions</h3>
      <p>
        Based on our findings and limitations, several promising directions for future research emerge:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Position-Specific Models</strong>: Developing specialized models for different positions (defenders, 
        midfielders, forwards, goalkeepers) could improve predictive accuracy.</li>
        <li><strong>Temporal Analysis</strong>: Analyzing how the importance of different attributes changes over time could 
        reveal evolving trends in player evaluation.</li>
        <li><strong>Advanced Feature Engineering</strong>: Exploring interaction effects between attributes might uncover more 
        complex relationships that influence player ratings.</li>
        <li><strong>Market Value Prediction</strong>: Extending our approach to predict player market values could provide 
        insights into the economic aspects of player valuation.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Conclusion</h3>
      <p>
        Our research demonstrates that machine learning techniques, particularly Random Forest models, can effectively 
        predict player overall ratings based on individual attributes in the FIFA database. The high accuracy of these 
        predictions not only validates the approach but also offers valuable insights for talent evaluation in football.
      </p>
      <p>
        The success of tree-based ensemble methods in this context suggests that the relationship between player attributes 
        and overall ratings involves complex, non-linear interactions that simpler models cannot fully capture. By 
        identifying the most influential attributes and developing accurate predictive models, this project contributes 
        to the growing field of sports analytics and offers practical tools for player assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an industry where identifying talent efficiently can provide significant competitive advantages, data-driven 
        approaches like ours represent an important complement to traditional scouting methods, potentially helping teams 
        make more informed decisions about player recruitment, development, and valuation.
